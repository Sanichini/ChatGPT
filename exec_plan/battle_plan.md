# Executive Battle Plan (Go‑to‑Market Strategy)

## Objective

Establish our new smartphone brand as a **top‑three player** in Thailand’s mass‑market segment (THB 5 000–15 000) within Q1–Q2 2025 while laying the foundation for sustainable growth. We will leverage real‑time market intelligence and predictive analytics to time our launch, price aggressively and out‑innovate incumbents.

## Target segments

1. **Content‑hungry Gen Z (ages 18‑24).** These users demand high refresh rates, strong cameras and long battery life. They are early adopters of social platforms and value creative expression.
2. **Young professionals (ages 25‑35).** They need reliable performance, fast charging and secure data storage for work‑life integration.
3. **First‑time 5G families & rural adopters.** They prioritise affordability, durability and connectivity across dual SIMs.

## Positioning & Unique Selling Propositions (USP)

* High‑end features (120 Hz display, AI video editing, Dimensity 8100 chip, IP68 rating) **without premium pricing**. Competitors seldom offer this combination under THB 10 000.
* **5 G for all:** dual‑SIM 5 G and eSIM options with expandable storage up to 1 TB provide future‑proofing.
* **All‑day endurance:** 5 000 mAh battery with 65 W fast charging ensures uninterrupted use.
* **Business‑grade security:** embedded secure element protects sensitive data—rare in this price range.

## Market entry timing

*Using predictive forecasting, we identified that competitor sales dip during the **Songkran holiday week (mid‑April 2025)**. This period shows the lowest predicted competitor shipments【816889315380161†L68-L115】. Launching immediately before Songkran maximises visibility and takes advantage of festive shopping.

## Pricing strategy

*Initial price:** THB 8 999. Our elasticity model suggests this maximises revenue by balancing demand and margin. We may adjust ±5 % based on competitor reactions.
*Bundle deals:** early adopters receive free memory card or earbuds. Lower‑storage variant at THB 7 499 targets price‑sensitive buyers.
*Flash sales:** real‑time scraping engine flags competitor price drops; we respond with limited‑hour promotions.

## Distribution & partnerships

*E‑commerce first:** Launch simultaneously on Shopee, Lazada, JD Central with exclusive vouchers. Use our anomaly detection engine to monitor price parity across platforms.
*Telco bundles:** Partner with AIS and True Corp to offer zero‑interest instalment plans and free data for 3 months, tapping into their duopoly presence【693812817783168†L58-L65】.
*Retail pop‑ups:** Set up experiential booths in universities and co‑working spaces. Demonstrate 120 Hz displays and AI editing.

## Marketing channels

1. **Influencer‑driven content:** Deploy the creative campaigns from the **Creative Campaign Factory**. Focus on TikTok and LINE, aligning with Gen Z and family segments.
2. **Performance ads:** Use Lookalike audiences based on competitor followers. Allocate 40 % of ad spend to TikTok, 30 % to Facebook/Instagram, 20 % to LINE, 10 % to Google/YouTube.
3. **Community building:** Launch a brand ambassador programme on university campuses. Encourage user‑generated content with hashtags and reward schemes.

## Resource allocation (Budget THB 50 M)

| Category | Allocation (THB M) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|

| **Contingency & R&D** | 8 | Buffer for price wars, supply shocks and future product iteration |

## Success metrics

* **Shipment target:** 100 k units in Q2 2025 (roughly 1.3 % of Thailand’s quarterly market assuming ~7.5 M unit market size).
* **Market share:** Achieve 3 % share by Q3 2025, placing us in the top five vendors.
* **Sell‑through rate:** >80 % of initial inventory within 60 days.
* **Brand awareness:** 50 % aided recall among target demographics via post‑launch surveys.

## Risk mitigation
