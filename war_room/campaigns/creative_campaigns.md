# Creative Campaign Concepts for the New Smartphone Brand

### Market backdrop

* The mass‑market (THB 5 000–15 000) segment remains fiercely competitive. Omdia’s Q3 2025 snapshot shows Samsung leading Thailand’s smartphone shipments with a **24 % share**, followed by **OPPO (17 %)**, **Xiaomi (15 %)** and **Apple (13 %)**【693812817783168†L38-L53】. Growing 5G adoption and aggressive mid‑range offerings are major drivers【693812817783168†L38-L53】.
* Southeast Asia’s smartphone market shrank 3 % in Q1 2025 due to economic pressure and weak demand in the entry‑level and mid‑tier brackets【816889315380161†L68-L79】. Despite the downturn, vendors like Samsung and Xiaomi posted strong mid‑range shipments【816889315380161†L88-L96】. Average selling prices increased **5 % year‑on‑year** as brands leaned into premium features【816889315380161†L81-L83】.
* Consumers are price‑sensitive yet demand value‑driven 5G devices, long battery life and strong camera performance—features repeatedly highlighted in the market reports【693812817783168†L38-L54】【816889315380161†L88-L104】. Our campaigns need to stand out by emphasising unique selling points (USP) while aligning with these demands.

## Concept 1 – “Next‑Gen Playground”

**Core idea:** Celebrate youthful creativity. Position the phone as the ultimate 5G‑enabled playground for Gen Z content creators—fast, fun and full of battery.

**USP:** Unlike competitors that prioritise camera megapixels alone, this device combines a **120 Hz display**, **5 000 mAh battery** and **AI‑powered video editor**. It lets users shoot, edit and post on a single device without worrying about power or lag.
